# Arrays


Arrays are not part of the heart of the spec Markdown, but they are part of GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) and Markdown Here includes them.

Here is an example of an array with the result below :

    | Arrays        | Are             | Cools |
    | ------------- |:---------------:| -----:|
    | col 3 est     |    right aligned| $1600 |
    | col 2 est     | centered        |   $12 |
    | zebras        | are swag        |    $1 |


| Arrays        | Are             | Cools |
| ------------- |:---------------:| -----:|
| col 3 est     |    right aligned| $1600 |
| col 2 est     | centered        |   $12 |
| zebras        | are swag        |    $1 |

Colons can be used to align the columns

Pipes (|) are optional and you don't need to do that raw Markdown aligns perfectly. You can also use inline Markdown.

Example:

    Pretty | Ugly | Markdown
    --- | --- | ---
    *Always* | `appears` | **good**
    1 | 2 | 3
